# UserInfo Component - Always Show Brands & Stores Summary

## Problem Solved

The user wanted to always show brands and stores in the UserInfo component so users can navigate to manage them, regardless of their seller status.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated UserInfo Component Logic

- **Changed condition**: Now shows RelationsSection if user is seller OR has existing brands/stores
- **Always loads relations**: Loads user's brands and stores regardless of seller status
- **Conditional create buttons**: Only shows create buttons when user is a seller

```tsx
// Before: Only showed for sellers
{user?.is_seller && (
  <RelationsSection ... />
)}

// After: Shows for sellers OR users with brands/stores
{(user?.is_seller || stores.length > 0 || brands.length > 0) && (
  <RelationsSection
    showCreateButtons={!!user?.is_seller}
    ...
  />
)}
```

### 2. Enhanced RelationsSection Component

- **Added showCreateButtons prop**: Controls whether create buttons are visible
- **Better empty states**: Different messages based on whether user can create or not
- **Help text for non-sellers**: Explains how to become a seller to create brands/stores
- **Added overview links**: "Ver todas (X)" links to dedicated list pages

### 3. Created Dedicated List Pages

#### My Brands Page (`/mi-perfil/my-brands/page.tsx`)

- **Grid layout**: Shows all brands in cards with status indicators
- **Quick actions**: Direct edit links and create buttons for sellers
- **Empty state**: Encourages sellers to create first brand
- **Back navigation**: Returns to profile page

#### My Stores Page (`/mi-perfil/my-stores/page.tsx`)

- **Grid layout**: Shows all stores in cards with status indicators
- **Store details**: Shows email, phone, website if available
- **Status badges**: Active/Inactive and Verified/Pending indicators
- **Quick actions**: Direct edit links and create buttons for sellers
- **Empty state**: Encourages sellers to create first store

### 4. Improved User Experience

#### For Regular Users (is_seller = false)

- **See existing**: Can view their brands/stores if they have any
- **Cannot create**: No create buttons shown
- **Guidance**: Blue info box explains how to become seller
- **Full access**: Can still edit existing brands/stores

#### For Sellers (is_seller = true)

- **Full functionality**: Can create, view, and edit brands/stores
- **Quick create**: Modal-based creation from profile
- **Overview pages**: Dedicated pages to manage multiple items
- **Helper text**: Guidance for creating first items

#### For Users with No Brands/Stores

- **Conditional display**: Section only shows if they have items OR are sellers
- **Clear guidance**: Different messages based on seller status
- **Call to action**: Sellers see create buttons, others see upgrade message

## Navigation Flow

```
Profile Page
├── For Sellers: Create buttons in RelationsSection
├── For All Users: "Ver todas (X)" links if they have items
├── Edit links: Direct to /my-brands/[slug] or /my-stores/[slug]
├── Overview pages: /my-brands and /my-stores
└── Back navigation: All pages return to profile
```

## Technical Implementation

### Props Enhancement

```tsx
interface Props {
  showCreateButtons?: boolean; // New prop to control create buttons
  // ... existing props
}
```

### Conditional Rendering

```tsx
{
  showCreateButtons && <CustomButton onClick={onCreateBrand} />;
}

{
  !showCreateButtons && stores.length === 0 && brands.length === 0 && (
    <div>Upgrade guidance</div>
  );
}
```

### Better Empty States

- **Context-aware messaging**: Different messages for sellers vs non-sellers
- **Visual hierarchy**: Cards, badges, and proper spacing
- **Action-oriented**: Clear next steps for users

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users can always access their brands/stores
2. **Seller Onboarding**: Clear path to becoming a seller
3. **Data Persistence**: Users don't lose access to old brands/stores
4. **Scalable Navigation**: Dedicated pages for managing multiple items
5. **Status Awareness**: Clear indication of active/inactive and verified status
6. **Contextual Actions**: Only show relevant actions based on user type

This update ensures that users always have visibility into their business assets while providing appropriate controls based on their current seller status.
